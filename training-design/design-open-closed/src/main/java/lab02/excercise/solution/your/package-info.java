 * The almanach of shapes cannot be extended easily.
 * You have to alter the class mutliple times if you want to add a new shape.
 * Increase flexibility, so that you have to touch the code only in one place to add one line to add a triangle.
 * <br>
 * or: Try to improve even further, so that you can add the triangle without touching an existing class (@see {@link java.util.ServiceLoader})
