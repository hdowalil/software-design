/**
 * Refactor package1 and 2 to make their containing classes more cohesive.
 * <br>
 * The classes in the subpackages of this packages reassamble the ones in the challenge.
 * Just the first letter differs and is Y isntead of C.
 * Let the dependencies inside the classes as they are right now when you refactor.
 * Just move the classes around, and create new packages if you like
