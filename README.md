# software-design
Samples that explain clean software design step-by-step

start with the training-clean, then do the excercises from training-design

most of the code-labs have a sample.
in the challenge you will see a sitation, that needs improvement
in the solution you will see, how i would refactor this example

when you saw this, you can do the exercise.
take a look at the challenge. then try to do your own solution
there will again be a refactoring done by me in solution.trainer
try not to look at that solution before you have done yours
